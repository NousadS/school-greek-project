    dialogSpeakerFirst: `By the gray eyes of Athena, what madness is this? Ten years you Achaeans have clawed at our walls like starving wolves. Now, suddenly, your ships turn their prows to the sea? Speak truth, or meet Hades swiftly.`,
    dialogSpeakerSecond: `If you flee, then explain this monstrosity of pine and fir standing in the sand. Why leave such a titan upon our shores? Is it a siege tower disguised as a beast?`,
    dialogSpeakerThird: `An offering? Then why craft it of such colossal girth? It is too wide for our gates and too tall for our temples. It seems built to mock us, not to honor a Goddess.`,
    dialogSpeakerFourth: `Your words flow like honey, Greek, but I smell the bile beneath. Why should I not put a torch to this wood and be done with it?`,

    dialogFirstA: `Lord Agamemnon bows to the will of the Gods. Calchas the Seer has proclaimed that victory is denied to us. We return to Argos to appease the angry skies.`,
    dialogFirstB: `We are tired and broken. Your walls are too strong, and Hector's ghost haunts our sleep. We surrender the field to you.`,
    dialogFirstC: `We leave because we have already won! We leave this land to rot, for it is not worth the blood of Achilles!`,
    
    dialogSecondA: `It is an offering to Pallas Athena. We stole her Palladium statue from your temple, and she has sent storms against us. This image is to replace what was taken and grant us safe voyage home.`,
    dialogSecondB: `It is a monument to the brave dead, both Greek and Trojan. A symbol of the peace we now seek.`,
    dialogSecondC: `It is a storage vessel for the treasures we could not carry. A tribute to your King Priam for his mercy.`,

    dialogThirdA: `Calchas ordered it built vast so that you could not bring it inside your city. For if you did, the protection of Athena would pass from us to you, and Troy would never fall.`,
    dialogThirdB: `Our builders were overcome with zeal! We wanted the Olympians to see our piety from the peaks of Mount Ida.`,
    dialogThirdC: `We built it large so that... it could hold enough distinct prayers for every soldier returning home.`,

    dialogFourthA: `Burn it, then. We wash our hands of it. But know that if you desecrate Athena's gift, her wrath will turn not on us, who built it, but on you, who destroyed it.`,
    dialogFourthB: `I swear on the River Styx, I tell no lies! Would a man alone and unarmed lie to a host of Trojans?`,
    dialogFourthC: `Do it then! Burn it! See if we care for your foolish superstitions!`,
